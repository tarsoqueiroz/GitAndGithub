Simple repo for testing!!!

In Markdown the _italic_ simple is formated with one underline. But if I use __two underlines__ I will put the text in bold.
The solution for ___italic in bold___ I need to use three underline.

And if I use *asterisc* the result is the same. With **two asterisc** we have a bold, and ***three asterisc*** we have italic bold.

> Using asterisc the formating will show in source text for all cases.

Another sample is `in line` code. It's not necessary put into ```three plics``` to the same example.

```
But in multiple lines is the same case
Muther fucker
```

    Another case without triple plicas
    You put four spaces before the text
